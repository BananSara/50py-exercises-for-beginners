1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python
2. Define a function max_of_three() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string.
4. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.
5. Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language"). That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string "tothohisos isos fofunon".
6. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in a list of numbers. For example, sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10, and multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24
7. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("I am testing") should return the string "gnitset ma I".
8. Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.
9. Write a function is_member() that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and a list of values a, and returns True if x is a member of a, False otherwise.
10. Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one member in common, False otherwise.
